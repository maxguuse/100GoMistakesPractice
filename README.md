# Examples for 100 mistakes in Go book

This is repository store my own examples which I wrote for `100 mistakes in Go` book. I don't stand for correctness of these examples, however that's how I see and understand them.

Note: 12, 15, 16 chapters are skipped due to them being more of documentation type errors.
